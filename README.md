New Horizons Renamer
=====

A simple tool for renaming a Town and Villagers for Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Intended for use with Ryujinx, where lots of people ended up using a template save.

It tries to find your saves in the Ryujinx directory, but it will also work on any loose save files.

Based on [NHSE](https://github.com/kwsch/NHSE), go check it out.

Make sure you back up your saves before doing this!

See the releases for binaries.
